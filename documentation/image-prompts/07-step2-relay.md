# How It Works - Step 2: Relay Server

## Specifications
- **Ratio**: 1:1 (square)
- **Purpose**: Illustration for "Connect via Relay" step
- **Output File**: `step-2-relay.png`

## Prompt

```
Create an illustration showing a central relay server connecting multiple devices securely.

CONCEPT:
A cloud server in the center acting as a hub, with multiple devices (phones, laptops, desktops) connected to it. The server routes messages but cannot read them (zero-knowledge).

ELEMENTS:
- Center: A cloud/server icon with the DaudAI logo or a relay symbol
- Surrounding it: 4-6 device icons (mix of phones and computers) arranged in a circle
- Connection lines from each device to the central server
- Small lock icons on the connection lines (encrypted)
- The server should have a "routing" visual (arrows going through it)
- Visual that suggests the server can't "see" - maybe envelope icons that pass through sealed
- Subtle "2" badge or step indicator

STYLE:
- Clean, flat illustration
- Top-down or isometric hub-and-spoke layout
- Color palette:
  - Orange: #E07A00, #F5921B (for connections, active elements)
  - Brown: #5C3D2E (for device outlines, server)
  - Cream: #FFF8F0 (backgrounds)
  - Light teal/green for "secure" indicators
- Network diagram aesthetic but friendly
- Emphasize the central routing concept

MOOD:
- "Everything connects through us"
- Secure and reliable
- Simple infrastructure concept

Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio

## Key Message
"The relay handles authentication and routes your encrypted messages. It can never read your content."

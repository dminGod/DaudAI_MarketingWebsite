## Specifications
- **Ratio**: 1:1 (square)
- **Purpose**: Illustration for "Control from Mobile" step
- **Output File**: `step-3-mobile.png`

## Prompt

```
Create an illustration showing a person controlling their desktop coding session from their phone while away from their desk.

CONCEPT:
A mobile phone in the foreground showing the DaudAI app interface, with a faded/ghosted desktop computer in the background. The phone is "controlling" the desktop remotely.

ELEMENTS:
- Foreground: A smartphone being held, showing app UI with:
  - A session card or chat interface
  - An "Approve" button highlighted (permission approval)
  - Orange accent colors
- Background (subtle/faded): A desktop computer with code on screen
- Visual connection between phone and desktop (dotted line, wifi waves, or glow)
- Maybe show a small notification badge on the phone
- Context suggesting mobility: could be outdoors, coffee shop vibe, or just abstract
- Subtle "3" badge or step indicator

STYLE:
- Clean, flat illustration
- Slight depth/perspective (phone closer, desktop farther)
- Color palette:
  - Orange: #E07A00, #F5921B (for app UI, highlights)
  - Brown: #5C3D2E (for outlines)
  - Cream: #FFF8F0 (backgrounds)
  - Desktop should be desaturated/faded
- Focus on the phone - it's the hero
- Freedom/mobility feeling

MOOD:
- "Control from anywhere"
- Freedom and flexibility
- Instant response capability
- Power in your pocket

Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio
